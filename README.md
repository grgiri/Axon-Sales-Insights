# Axon-Sales-Insights


## Overview
Axon, a small retail company specializing in classic cars, is encountering challenges with managing and analyzing their sales data. The lack of a centralized system for data analysis has led to difficulties in decision-making due to inaccurate and outdated sales reports. This capstone project aims to address these challenges by implementing a BI solution using PowerBI and SQL, enabling effective data management and analysis.

## Objective
The primary goal is to design and implement a business intelligence (BI) solution that allows for efficient management and analysis of sales data. This solution will:
1. Integrate sales data from a MySQL database into PowerBI for centralized data management.
2. Clean and transform the data within PowerBI to ensure it is analysis-ready.
3. Develop interactive dashboards and reports in PowerBI to aid the sales team and management in understanding the data.
4. Utilize SQL for advanced analytics to derive insights that could improve sales.
5. Provide real-time access to dashboards and reports for informed decision-making by the management.

## MySQL Database Schema
The database consists of eight tables critical for sales data analysis:
- **Customers**: Contains data on customers.
- **Products**: Lists the scale model cars available for sale.
- **ProductLines**: Categorizes the products into different product lines.
- **Orders**: Records sales orders placed by customers.
- **OrderDetails**: Details each sales order's line items.
- **Payments**: Tracks payments made by customers.
- **Employees**: Includes information on employees and the organizational structure, highlighting reporting lines.
- **Offices**: Contains data on sales offices.

## Tools Required
- **MySQL (Version 8.0+)**: For database management and advanced analytics.
- **PowerBI Desktop**: For creating interactive dashboards and reports.
